There are a number of options for starting with an AI generated Application, with all the Instant AI App Generators like 
[Google's App Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apps) able to provide a great starting point. Although currently Professional Developers tend to use 
[Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) or 
[Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) as their day-to-day tools of choice. 

### Use GitHub Copilot when creating a new Repository

If you're using [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) you can also use it to generate a new App 
[from the React Static template ](https://github.com/new?template_name=react-static&template_owner=NetCoreTemplates):

<div className="not-prose">
    <a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=react-static&template_owner=NetCoreTemplates">
    <img src="/img/react-new-repo.webp" alt="New Repo" className="my-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow hover:shadow-xl" />
    </a>
</div>

For the example, I've started with a useful App that I've never created before, a Budget Planner App, using the prompt:

### Budget Planner Prompt

```
- React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4
- Persistence in IndexedDB/localStorage
- Recharts
- Vitest with React Testing Library

## Features
Dashboard
- Overview of total income, expenses, and remaining budget
- Monthly summary chart (line graph)
- Expense categories (pie chart)

Transactions
- Add/Edit/Delete income or expenses
- Date filtering/sorting

Budgets
- Set monthly budget goals per category
- Progress bars for spending vs. budget

Reports
- View past months
- Export
```

The generated source code for the App was uploaded to: [github.com/mythz/budgets.apps.cafe](https://github.com/mythz/budgets.apps.cafe)

### Budgent Planner App

After a few minutes Copilot creates a PR with what we asked for, even things that we didn't specify in the prompt but could be inferred from the Project Template like **Dark Mode** support where it made use of the existing `<DarkModeToggle />`.

}} />

### Prompt AI to add new Features

AI Assistance doesn't end after the initial implementation as AI Models and tools are more than capable to
create 100% of the React UI now, including new features, fixes and other improvements. For this example I used
Claude Code to Implement Category Auto-Tagging with this prompt:

    Implement Category Auto-Tagging

    Allow specifying tags when creating a new transaction.
    When users add a transaction, try to predict the tag from the Description, e.g:

    Input: “Starbucks latte” → Suggests category: Food & Drinks
    Input: “Uber to work” → Suggests category: Transport

    Implementation:

    Maintain a small local list of common keywords + categories.
    Pre-fill category in the transaction form as the user types in the Description.

Which resulted in [this commit](https://github.com/mythz/budgets.apps.cafe/commit/e45a17b8dfd2b5983971554ced3e52ded6fa050e) which sees the feature available in the UI:

<div className="not-prose">
    <img src="/img/budget/expense-tags-dark.webp" alt="Expense Tags" className="w-full h-auto max-w-3xl rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
</div>

Along with different seed data, tailored for Income and Expenses:
 - [categoryAutoTag.ts](https://github.com/mythz/budgets.apps.cafe/blob/main/MyApp.Client/src/lib/categoryAutoTag.ts)
 
And 19 passing tests to verify a working implementation:
 
 - [categoryAutoTag.test.ts](https://github.com/mythz/budgets.apps.cafe/blob/main/MyApp.Client/src/lib/categoryAutoTag.test.ts)

Combined with Vite's instant hot-reload, this creates a remarkably fluid development experience where
we get to watch our prompts materialize into working features in real-time.
