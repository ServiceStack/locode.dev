# Next.js Static Template

The `next-static` template is designed for building high-performance, static websites using Next.js and ServiceStack. It combines the SEO benefits of Static Site Generation (SSG) with the dynamic capabilities of a .NET backend.

## Features

- **Next.js SSG**: Pre-render pages at build time for blazing fast load speeds.
- **ServiceStack Backend**: Full .NET 8 Web API with AutoQuery, Auth, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid styling with utility classes.
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety.
- **Docker Support**: Ready for deployment with Docker and Kamal.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a clean monorepo structure:

- `MyApp/`: The ASP.NET Core backend.
- `MyApp.Client/`: The Next.js frontend application.
- `MyApp.ServiceModel/`: Shared DTOs.
- `MyApp.ServiceInterface/`: Service implementations.

## Getting Started

To create a new project with this template:

```bash
npx create-net next-static ProjectName
```

### Development

Run the following command to start both the backend and frontend in development mode:

```bash
dotnet watch
```

This will launch the .NET API and the Next.js dev server, with proxying configured automatically.

## Deployment

The template includes GitHub Actions for building and deploying your application using Kamal. It produces a single Docker image containing both the .NET backend and the static frontend assets.
