# .NET 10 Full-featured Next.js Static Export Identity Auth Template

import TemplateIntro from '@/components/template-intro';

A modern full-stack .NET 10.0 + Next.js 16 project template that combines the power of ServiceStack with Next.js static site generation and React 19. It provides a production-ready foundation for building scalable web applications with integrated authentication, database management, and background job processing.

  repo="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/nextjs"
  demo="https://nextjs.react-templates.net"
  name="Next.js Static Export Template"
/>

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-net nextjs MyProject
```

## Getting Started

Run Server .NET Project (automatically starts both .NET and Next.js dev servers):

```bash
cd MyProject
dotnet watch
```

## Architecture

### Hybrid Development Approach

This template uses a hybrid architecture that differs between development and production environments:

**Development Mode:**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs.servicestack.net/refs/heads/main/MyApp/wwwroot/img/pages/react/info/next-static-dev.svg)

- ASP.NET Core proxies requests to Next.js dev server (running on port 3000)
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support for instant UI updates
- WebSocket proxying for Next.js HMR functionality
- Automatic startup of Next.js dev server in `dotnet watch`

**Production Mode:**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs.servicestack.net/refs/heads/main/MyApp/wwwroot/img/pages/react/info/next-static-prod.svg)

- Next.js app is statically exported to `/dist`
- Static files served directly from ASP.NET Core's `/wwwroot`
- No separate Node.js server required in production
- Single container deployment with all static assets

## Core Technologies

### Frontend (Next.js 16 + React 19)
- **Next.js** with static export capability
- **Tailwind CSS 4.x** - Utility-first styling with dark mode support

- **ServiceStack React Components** - Pre-built UI components
- **SWR** - React Hooks for data fetching with caching

### Backend (.NET 10.0)
- **ServiceStack 10.x** - High-performance web services framework
- **ASP.NET Core Identity Auth** - Complete authentication & authorization system
- **Entity Framework Core** - For Identity Auth data management

- Type-safe TypeScript DTOs auto-generated from C# models
- AutoQueryGrid component for rapid data grids

### 3. AI Chat Integration

- Markdown with React components
- Syntax highlighting with Prism.js
- Static generation - pre-rendered at build time
- YAML frontmatter metadata
- Custom remark plugin for YouTube embeds
- Beautiful typography with `@tailwindcss/typography`

### 6. Developer Experience
- **Admin UI** at `/admin-ui` for App management
- **Health checks** at `/up` endpoint
- **Modular startup** configuration pattern
- **Code-first migrations** with EF Core
- **Request logging** with SqliteRequestLogger
- **OpenAPI 3.0** with Scalar API documentation at `/scalar/v1`
- **Docker support** with container publishing
- **Kamal deployment** configuration included

### 7. Production Features
- Static asset serving from ASP.NET Core
