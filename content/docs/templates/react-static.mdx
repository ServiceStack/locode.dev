# React Static Template

The `react-static` template offers a classic Single Page Application (SPA) experience, optimized for productivity and simplicity. It uses Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement.

## Features

- **Vite**: Lightning-fast dev server and bundler.
- **React SPA**: Client-side routing and rendering.
- **ServiceStack Backend**: Robust .NET 8 API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern styling.
- **TypeScript**: Typed DTOs and components.

## Ideal Use Cases

- **Dashboards**: Admin panels and internal tools.
- **SaaS Applications**: Rich, interactive web apps.
- **Mobile Wrappers**: Apps that need to be wrapped for mobile stores.

## Getting Started

Create a new project:

```bash
x new react-static ProjectName
```

### Development

Start the development environment:

```bash
dotnet watch
```

This command spins up the ASP.NET Core backend and the Vite dev server.

## Architecture

In production, the React app is built into static files and served directly by the ASP.NET Core Kestrel server, simplifying deployment to a single binary or container.
