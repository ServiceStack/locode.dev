# .NET 10 React Static Template

import TemplateIntro from '@/components/template-intro';

A modern full-stack .NET 10.0 + React Vite project template that combines the power of ServiceStack with React Vite static site generation and React 19. It provides a production-ready foundation for building scalable web applications with integrated authentication, database management, and background job processing.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-net react-static MyProject
```

## Getting Started

Run Server .NET Project (automatically starts both .NET and Vite React dev servers):

```bash
cd MyProject
dotnet watch
```

## Architecture

### Hybrid Development Approach

**Development Mode:**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs.servicestack.net/refs/heads/main/MyApp/wwwroot/img/pages/react/info/react-static-dev.svg)

- ASP.NET Core proxies requests to Vite dev server (running on port 5173)
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support for instant UI updates
- WebSocket proxying for Vite HMR functionality

**Production Mode:**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs.servicestack.net/refs/heads/main/MyApp/wwwroot/img/pages/react/info/react-static-prod.svg)

- Vite React app is statically exported to `/dist`
- Static files served directly from ASP.NET Core's `/wwwroot`
- No separate Node.js server required in production

## Core Technologies

### Frontend

- **React 19** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite 7** - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - CSS-first configuration with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- **TypeScript 5** - JavaScript with syntax for types
- **Vitest** - Modern testing framework
- **ServiceStack React Components** - Pre-built UI components

### .NET Frontend (Integrated + Optional)
- **Razor Pages** - For Identity Auth UI (`/Identity` routes)

### Backend (.NET 10.0)
- **ServiceStack 10.x** - High-performance web services framework
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** - Complete authentication & authorization system
- **Entity Framework Core** - For Identity data management
- **OrmLite** - ServiceStack's fast, lightweight Typed ORM for application data
- **SQLite** - Default database (easily upgradable to PostgreSQL/SQL Server/MySQL)

## Major Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ASP.NET Core Identity integration with role-based access control
- Custom user sessions with additional claims
- Admin users feature for user management at `/admin-ui/users`
- Email confirmation workflow (configurable SMTP)
- Razor Pages for Identity UI (`/Identity` routes)
- Credentials-based authentication

### [2. AutoQuery CRUD](#autoquery-crud-dev-workflow)
- Declarative API development with minimal code
- Complete Auth-protected CRUD operations (see Bookings example at `/bookings-auto`)
- Automatic audit trails (created/modified/deleted tracking)
- Built-in validation and authorization
- Type-safe TypeScript DTOs auto-generated from C# models

### 3. Background Jobs
- `BackgroundsJobFeature` for async task processing
- Command pattern for job execution
- Email sending via background jobs
- Recurring job scheduling support
- Upgradable to `DatabaseJobsFeature` for enterprise RDBMS

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Admin UI** at `/admin-ui` for App management
- **Health checks** at `/up` endpoint
- **Modular startup** configuration pattern
- **Code-first migrations** with OrmLite
- **Docker support** with container publishing
- **Kamal deployment** configuration included

### 5. Production Features
- Static asset caching with intelligent cache invalidation
- Clean URLs without `.html` extensions
- HTTPS redirection and HSTS
- Data protection with persistent keys
- Health monitoring
- Database developer page for EF Core errors

## Development Workflow

For detailed information on the development workflow, including starting development servers, generating TypeScript DTOs, database migrations, and testing, see:

**[Development Workflow Documentation](/autoquery/dev-workflow)**

## Configuration

For detailed configuration information, including app settings, SMTP email setup, and upgrading to enterprise databases (PostgreSQL/SQL Server/MySQL), see:

**[Configuration Documentation](/configuration)**

## Deployment

For deployment instructions, including Docker + Kamal setup and GitHub Actions configuration, see:

**[Deployment Documentation](/deployment)**

## AutoQuery CRUD Dev Workflow

For Rapid Development simple [TypeScript Data Models](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery/okai-models) can be used to generate C# AutoQuery APIs and DB Migrations.

### Cheat Sheet

Create a new Table use `init <Table>`, e.g:

```bash
npx okai init Table
```

This will generate an empty `MyApp.ServiceModel/<Table>.d.ts` file along with stub AutoQuery APIs and DB Migration implementations. 

#### Regenerate AutoQuery APIs and DB Migrations

After modifying the TypeScript Data Model to include the desired fields, re-run the `okai` tool to re-generate the AutoQuery APIs and DB Migrations:

```bash
npx okai Table.d.ts
```

> Command can be run anywhere within your Solution

After you're happy with your Data Model you can run DB Migrations to run the DB Migration and create your RDBMS Table:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

#### Making changes after first migration

If you want to make further changes to your Data Model, you can re-run the `okai` tool to update the AutoQuery APIs and DB Migrations, then run the `rerun:last` npm script to drop and re-run the last migration:

```bash
npm run rerun:last
```

#### Removing a Data Model and all generated code

If you changed your mind and want to get rid of the RDBMS Table you can revert the last migration:

```bash
npm run revert:last
```

Which will drop the table and then you can get rid of the AutoQuery APIs, DB Migrations and TypeScript Data model with:

```bash
npx okai rm Transaction.d.ts
```

## Ideal Use Cases

- SaaS applications requiring authentication
- Admin dashboards with CRUD operations
- Content-driven sites with dynamic APIs
- Applications needing background job processing
- Projects requiring both SSG benefits and API capabilities
- Teams wanting type-safety across full stack
