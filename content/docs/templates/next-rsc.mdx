# Next.js RSC Template

The `next-rsc` template leverages React Server Components (RSC) to bring the power of the server to your React components. It's the cutting edge of React development, integrated seamlessly with ServiceStack.

## Features

- **React Server Components**: Fetch data directly in your components on the server.
- **Next.js App Router**: The latest routing paradigm from Next.js.
- **ServiceStack Integration**: Call your .NET services directly from Server Components.
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Mix server and client components for the best of both worlds.

## Why RSC?

React Server Components allow you to keep sensitive logic and large dependencies on the server, sending only the necessary HTML and minimal JavaScript to the client. This results in:

- **Smaller Bundle Sizes**: Less JS to download and parse.
- **Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Content is rendered on the server.
- **Simplified Data Fetching**: No need for `useEffect` or complex state management for initial data.

## Getting Started

Generate a new project:

```bash
npx create-net next-rsc ProjectName
```

### Development

As with other templates, use `dotnet watch` to start the unified development experience.

```bash
dotnet watch
```

## Learn More

This template is perfect for developers who want to stay ahead of the curve and utilize the latest React features while maintaining a robust .NET backend.
