# React .NET Templates

**Vibe Coding** is a new paradigm for building web applications, combining the best-in-class technologies for a developer experience that feels like magic.

It leverages the power of **AI-Generated Development** with a stack that is optimized for code generation, type safety, and performance.

## The Vibe Stack

The "Vibe Stack" consists of:

- **React**: The library for web and native user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **ServiceStack**: A high-performance .NET framework for building industrial-strength backends.

## Why Vibe Coding?

### AI-Optimized
The combination of React, Tailwind, and TypeScript is widely recognized as the optimal target for LLM code generation. The declarative nature of React and the utility classes of Tailwind allow AI to generate complete, styled components with high accuracy.

### Type-Safe End-to-End
ServiceStack extends TypeScript's type safety to the network boundary. With **Add ServiceStack Reference**, you get instant, typed DTOs for your API, ensuring that your frontend and backend are always in sync.

### Industrial Strength
While the frontend is built for speed and flexibility, the backend is built for stability and performance. ServiceStack provides a mature, feature-rich foundation for your applications, including:

- **AutoQuery**: Instant APIs for your data.
- **Auth**: Built-in authentication and authorization.
- **Validation**: Fluent validation for your request DTOs.
- **Messaging**: Background jobs and message queues.
