# Key Features

The Vibe Stack isn't just a collection of libraries; it's a cohesive ecosystem designed for productivity.

## Type-Safe APIs

One of the biggest challenges in full-stack development is keeping the frontend and backend in sync. ServiceStack solves this with **Add ServiceStack Reference**.

- **Single Source of Truth**: Your C# DTOs are the master definition.
- **Automated Generation**: TypeScript interfaces are generated automatically.
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Catch errors before you run your app.

## AutoQuery

Stop writing boilerplate CRUD code. AutoQuery lets you define your data requirements with simple Request DTOs, and ServiceStack handles the implementation.

```csharp
[Route("/bookings", "GET")]
public class QueryBookings : QueryDb<Booking> 
{
    public string? NameContains { get; set; }
}
```

This single class creates a fully functional, optimized API endpoint with filtering, sorting, and paging.

## Built-in Auth

ServiceStack includes a comprehensive authentication system with support for:

- **Credentials**: Email/Password.
- **OAuth**: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication for scalable APIs.
- **API Keys**: Secure access for third-party integrations.

## Admin UI

Every ServiceStack project comes with a built-in Admin UI, giving you instant visibility into your:

- **Users & Roles**: Manage access.
- **Database**: Browse and edit data.
- **Request Logs**: Debug issues.
- **Background Jobs**: Monitor async tasks.

## Validation

Fluent Validation is integrated into the core. Define rules for your DTOs, and they are enforced automatically. Errors are propagated to the client and can be displayed instantly in your UI.

```csharp
public class CreateBookingValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateBooking>
{
    public CreateBookingValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotEmpty();
        RuleFor(x => x.RoomType).IsInEnum(typeof(RoomType));
    }
}
```
